Unification: 

Formal Definition: Two terms unify if they are the same term or if they contain variables that can be uniformly instantiated with terms in such a way that the resulting terms are equal.  


Let woman(X) be defined by the rule  
woman(X) :- female(X). 

Let the fact(s) 
female(mia).  be in the Knowledge Base.     

Imagine the following query, 
? woman(mia). 

Prolog unifies woman(X) with woman(mia) , thereby instantiating the variable X to mia .
Simplified steps the Prolog Interpreter takes (try running the program using ?trace woman(mia)) 

1) X is instantiated as the atom  mia.
2) Prolog searches a knowledge base to see if query is satisfied (proof search) 
3) Prolog continues to unify and search the KB to determine if the query can be
satisfied.
